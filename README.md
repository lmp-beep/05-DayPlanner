# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

https://lmp-beep.github.io/05-DayPlanner/

This is a simple calendar app for scheduling appointments during working hours. The user can add text to each time block and save it by clicking the lock button. The info will be stored in local storage and will not be deleted upon refresh or reload. The colors of each time block vary based on the current time. Past hours appear grey, future hours appear green, and the current hour appears red.
